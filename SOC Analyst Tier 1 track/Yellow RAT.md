## 🛡️ Recommended Actions

### **Immediate Containment**
1. Quarantine affected systems
2. Block C2 domain (`gogohid.com`) at network perimeter
3. Search for `solarmarker.dat` across endpoints
4. Check registry for suspicious autostart entries

### **Detection Rules**
```yaml
# YARA Rule (conceptual)
rule Yellow_Cockatoo_RAT {
    strings:
        $uuid_name = /[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}\.dll/
        $appdata_file = "solarmarker.dat"
    condition:
        any of them
}
```

### **Prevention Measures**
- Implement application whitelisting
- Monitor for suspicious .dll files with UUID names
- Enable HTTPS inspection for C2 detection
- Regular user awareness training on SEO poisoning tactics

---

## 📈 Threat Intelligence Context

## 📝 Analyst Notes
- The malware uses HTTPS for C2, making network detection more challenging
- UUID-style naming attempts to blend with legitimate system files
- The ~3-week gap between compilation and first submission suggests targeted deployment
- Browser redirects are a primary user-visible symptom
